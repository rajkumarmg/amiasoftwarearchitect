Software Architecture
## Going to capture few things that I came across related to software architecture
- UML
- 4+1 view by Philippe Kruchten
- Design patterns
- Data structures & Algorithms
- SOLID principles
- Coupling and Cohesion concepts
- RDBMS and No-Sql concepts
- REST
- Architecture styles
- OOA (Object Ariented Analysis)
- OOD (Object Oriented Design)
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Strong in Java or C# or Javascript (C or C++)
- Network Layers
- TCP/IP/HTTP
- Unix philosophy
- MVC, MVP, MVVM
- Distributed system concepts
- Non-Functional requirements
- and many more...
But can it be made as simple as 4+1 view by Philippe Kruchten?
## Few thoughts
- keep the functions in microservice small enough to be represented by sequence diagram (uml).
