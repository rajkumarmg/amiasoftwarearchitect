Software Architecture
## Going to capture few things that I came across related to software architecture
- UML
- 4 + 1 view by Philippe Kruchten (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model, https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf)
- Design patterns
- Data structures & Algorithms
- SOLID principles
- Coupling and Cohesion concepts
- RDBMS and No-Sql concepts
- REST
- Architecture styles
- OOA (Object Ariented Analysis)
- OOD (Object Oriented Design)
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Strong in Java or C# or Javascript (C or C++)
- Network Layers
- TCP/IP/HTTP
- Unix philosophy
- MVC, MVP, MVVM
- Distributed system concepts
- and many more...
But is it possible to keep it simple?
## Few thoughts
- keep the functions in microservice small enough to be represented by sequence diagram (uml).
