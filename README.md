Am I a software architect?
## Let me list down what I have been doing since 1998.
- [1999-2000] Took the existing hospital management system and redesigned the system, because I was not able to understand the code. But used the same MSAccess database backend. This was a MSAccess application written in VB. Basicly a standalone desktop application running on only one machine.
- [2000-2009] TBC...
